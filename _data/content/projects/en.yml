        # Cross-lingual Representation using the Graph-Transformer model

        A graph-based approach for cross-lingual plagiarism detection that represents text fragments in different languages using multilingual knowledge graphs. Putting forward a new graph representation method based on the Transformer architecture that uses explicit relation encoding and provides a more efficient way for global graph representation.

        # Document Representation using the Topic-Transformer model
        A transformer-based Language Model is addressed to capture global semantic meaning relating to words of a document by incorporating a Topic Model. (Coding tools: Pytorch)

        # Authorship Verification using Style Embedding model
        Proposing approach using unsupervised learning to determine whether a given document is multi-authored and find the borders where authors writing styles switch, by using Bi-LSTM-based syntax embeddings along with the BERT model. (Coding tools: Pytorch)

        # Citations Mapping
        A method of sentences and citation representations, leveraging Convolutional Neural Network and Auto-encoder models. This task performs the mapping between citations and the calculation o semantic similarities, thus the detection of plagiarism in scientific papers corpus. (Coding tools: TensorFlow )
