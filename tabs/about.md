I am a Machine Learning and NLP researcher with a PhD in Computer Science from Hassan II University of Casablanca, Morocco. My research focuses on developing deep learning approaches to tackle various NLP tasks, including multilingual NLP tasks, Semantic Textual Similarity, Representation Learning, GNNs for text, Authorship Detection, Topic Modelling, and Low-resource language modelling.

My doctoral research involved proposing multiple approaches based on Deep Learning to detect paraphrastic and cross-lingual plagiarism. Through this work, I gained extensive experience in designing and implementing deep learning models, data preprocessing, and feature extraction. I also have experience in using various tools and technologies, including TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and NLTK.

I am passionate about using NLP to improve social welfare, and I am constantly exploring new avenues to apply NLP to solve real-world problems. I am always eager to collaborate with other researchers and organizations to make meaningful contributions to the field of NLP.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my website, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential research collaborations.
